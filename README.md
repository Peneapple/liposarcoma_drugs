# 2D to 3D Molecular Structure Conversion

## Overview

This repository provides a pipeline for converting molecular structures from 2D SDF format to 3D SDF format. The conversion is particularly recommended for molecules with **complex stereochemistry**, ensuring accurate geometric and stereochemical configurations, including the correct placement of chiral hydrogen atoms.

## Features

- ✅ 2D-SDF to 3D-SDF conversion using **RDKit**
- ✅ Geometry optimization with **Universal Force Field (UFF)**
- ✅ Supports **macOS**, **Linux**, and **Google Colab**
- ✅ Includes example models for validation

## Resources

- The **source code** and **sample data** are included in this repository.
- We also provide **reference 3D models** generated by several popular online tools for comparison.
- ⚠️ Note: The structures generated by **Method-3** are incorrect in both test cases due to failure in handling stereochemistry.
